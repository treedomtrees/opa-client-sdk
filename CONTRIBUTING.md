# Contributing to this repo

## Introduction

In Treedom, we believe in empowering our contributors by providing them with commit access to the project. This approach enables our project to evolve, allowing contributions to flow freely from individuals who demonstrate significant and valuable input.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain the integrity and quality of the project, we ask our contributors to adhere to the following rules:

1. **Avoid `--force` pushes** to the `main` branch or altering the Git history in any form once a PR has been merged.
2. **Use non-main branches** for work in progress and ongoing contributions.
3. Contributors are encouraged to follow the established code-style to ensure consistency.
4. A minimum of two contributors is required to approve pull-requests before they can be merged.
5. All continuous integration (CI) checks must pass before a pull-request is eligible for merging.
6. SemVer-major changes require a lead maintainer's approval for merging.
7. In instances where consensus on a pull-request cannot be reached, the final decision will be made by the Treedom development team.
